        "Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 require significant computational resources for full fine-tuning, making it impractical for users with limited hardware. This demo addresses the challenge of **efficiently adapting pre-trained LLMs to custom tasks** using **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), while avoiding memory-intensive optimizations like `BitsAndBytes` (8-bit quantization).\n",

        "1. **Demonstrate LoRA-based fine-tuning** of GPT-2 on a toy dataset without advanced quantization.  \n",
        "2. **Minimize computational overhead** by freezing the base model and training only low-rank adapter layers.  \n",
        "3. **Showcase a lightweight workflow** for causal language modeling (text generation) using Hugging Face tools (`transformers`, `peft`, `datasets`).  \n",

        "2. **Reduced GPU memory usage** compared to full fine-tuning (achieved via LoRA's low-rank matrices).  \n",
        "3. **Logs and checkpoints** saved in `./results` for evaluation.  \n",
        "4. **Validation of the approach** through:  \n",
        "   - Successful training/evaluation loop execution.  \n",

        "- **Tokenization**: Proper handling of padding/truncation for causal LM.  \n",

        "Pretrained language models like GPT-2 often exhibit generic and inconsistent outputs when prompted with sentences across various domains (e.g., health, sports, technology, etc.). This case study aims to fine-tune GPT-2 using a more **diverse**, **theme-rich**, and **semi-synthetic dataset** to improve the model’s ability to produce **coherent and domain-aligned completions**. The goal is to test how a **larger, structured, and varied dataset** enhances fine-tuning effectiveness when combined with **LoRA-based parameter-efficient methods**.\n",

The goal of this code is to **enhance emotional text generation** by fine-tuning a **stronger instruction-tuned model**—`TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`—on 5000 training and 1000 testing examples using **LoRA-based parameter-efficient tuning** with **8-bit quantization**.\n",
